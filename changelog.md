* Another week of very little visible dev.

## Fixes
* Fixed internal code issues so I could actually start to develop extra screens before the world start.

## Issues
* Gui size on fullscreen is all gunked up. Prolly because I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

# v20151011
## News
* This version is heavily underworked because of a busy week and I was travelling! (thi is being commited from the damn hostel)
* Shadow guards! (but then don't actually work like I want then to and they're nowhere to be found)
* World 2_1 is playable but rather underwhelming
* Lots of general organization and other little fixes that doen't really impact any of the gameplay.
* Implesmented warping to the debugg controls (check the readme file)
* I dont know what else!

## Fixes
* Glass block fixes (yes, they wasn't even in any stage and where borked).

# v20151004
## News
* Small room fixes to make then more clean and streamlined (can't remember what it was because I didn't write it down)
* Groundwork to actually doing cutscenes (if the game is running a custscene player loses control)
* Background objects
* Signs placed around some stages
* Small behavior change to runner slimes (other slimes blocks vision)
* Basic pausing (P to pause)
* Fullscreen enabled (F to toggle)
* Fake walls for secret passages (none ingame yet, tho)
* Two different characters that don't actually change anything at all. It will be used later. (X to toggle)

## World 2 features (not yet ingame)
* Jumping slimes (like runners but they jump around)
* Glass block (slimes can see through but it act as a solid)

## Fixes
* A hundred and two fixes to runner slime because it was broken and re broken

## Issues
* Pausing is stupid and crappy, needs to be worked on and at least display a text saying that the game is paused
* While jumping to 3 blocks up, before landing the obj stops 1px before the actual block and then lands
* Second character's color is really bad and hard to see
* Size of text while on fullscreen is really messed up and need to be fixed
