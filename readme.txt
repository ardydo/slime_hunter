Gameplay:
  You walk around and deal with slimes with different properties. This is basically it.
  As of now, there is only world 1 done. You can complete it and walk back to the entrance of world 2 but it will actually end the game.

Secrets:
  One of my game's feature is going to be silly easter eggs and secrets and as such, there is already some hidden features... Useless, but hidden nonetheless.
  Can you find it?
